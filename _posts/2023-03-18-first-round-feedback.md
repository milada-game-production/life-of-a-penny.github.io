We had our peers play our prototypes in class and provide feedbacks for improvement. Some of the feedbacks we got and need to improve on are:


Peer #1
- How to’s Instruction page or even a mini tutorial may be helpful
- Include cues to get damage
- Enemy taking damage 
- The dash is delayed need to fix
- Maybe some sort of effect or indicator for wall jump??

Peer #2
- Sprint should include a knock 
- Reference Pizza tower (similar mechanics)
- Include something that will give the feeling that it’s rolling, and will roll faster as it goes uninterrupted
- Spin should not be mouse click, maybe about keyboard button
- Sliding down should have friction animation (sparks?)
- Holding shift, revs up spin?

Peer #3
- Attach to the flag and raise the flag
- Kill stuff
- Add power ups
- More colors 
- Add sound effects

Peer #4
- Work on the spinning (looks like it’s vibrating)
- Skidding? Feeling of momentum 
- Knockback effect?
- Health spread shifts when life is lost
- Sort layers for sprites and canvas
