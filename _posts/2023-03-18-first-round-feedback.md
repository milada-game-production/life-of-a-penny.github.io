We had our peers play our prototypes in class and provide feedbacks for improvement. Some of the feedbacks we got and need to improve on are:


Peer #1
How to’s 
Queue to get damage
Enemy taking damage 
Delayed dash
Indicator for wall jump??

Peer #2
Sprint has a knock 
Pizza tower (similar mechanics)
Give the feeling that it’s rolling, and will roll faster as it goes uninterrupted
Spin should not be mouse click, maybe about keyboard button
Sliding down should have friction animation (sparks?)
Holding shift, revs up spin?

Peer #3
Attach to the flag and raise the flag
Kill stuff
Add power ups
More colors 
Add sound effects

Peer #4
Work on the spinning (looks like it’s vibrating)
Skidding? Feeling of momentum 
Knockback effect?
Health spread shifts when life is lost
Sort layers for sprites and canvas
