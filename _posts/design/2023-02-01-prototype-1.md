In creating this game, our first version focused quite a bit on the movement. Making sure our coin could move from side to side, dash, spin attack and wall jump. We were still figuring out the kinks in how to create an attack, how to indicate that we took an attack. 

In this version of our Build, we could run through the level, but unfortunately had no way to attack the enemies back, only receive damage.
