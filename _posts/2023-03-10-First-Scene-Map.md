The game is coming along, a few new additions have been added such as the creation of overall scene: The couch origin story. 

The background image of the couch has been created as well as the tile map on top of it. 

This maps the first initial level. As we continued, more features were included, such as a rotating keyring, dust bunnies, dust balls, and our checkpoint flag.
